Recently I’ve been taking a more active interest in the sharing economy, particularly with the seemingly meteoric success of global start-up’s like Airbnb and Uber and the impact they are having in Australia.

I’ve collected some current articles about the topic:

The Age about some of the [legal challenges](https://www.theage.com.au/education/the-sharing-economy-20140303-33ygj.html) facing the sharing economy. Great to see law firm [Ashurst Australia](https://www.ashurst.com/) teaming up with Melbourne Uni to provide the Sustainability Business Clinic where law students provide legal advice to start-up companies under the supervision and guidance of environmental lawyers.

ABC News article about [the benefits of providing sharing economy services](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-05/airbnb-uber-proving-a-hit-as-australia-turns-to-sharing-economy/5650484) Airbnb, Uber proving a hit as Australians turn to ‘sharing economy’ to make extra money

So what about Australian start ups?

Chris Riedy [@chrisjriedy](https://twitter.com/chrisjriedy) has put together a great list in his blog post called [Collaborative consumption](http://chrisriedy.me/collaborative-consumption-in-australia/) in Australia which features a number of Australian businesses. The list is categorised as Product Service Systems (or PSS), Redistribution Markets and Collaborative Lifestyles
